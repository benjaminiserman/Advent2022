# Advent2022

These are my solutions for Advent of Code 2022. 
I was trying to compete for top 100 solves this year, so the code is not necessarily well written, but it works. 
The solution to run is chosen by changing the class executed on [Program.cs:11](https://github.com/winggar/Advent2022/blob/master/Program.cs#L11).

## File Naming Conventions

Each name is composed of the word day two numbers separated by an underscore (\_).
The first number is the day, the second number is the part.

Optionally, a name has a second underscore with a comment after it.
These represent alternate solutions to the same problem that I wrote after initially completing the problem.

For example: Day05_2.cs represents my initial solution to Day 5 Part 2.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo to your machine.
2. Open the .sln file in your preferred C# IDE.
3. Change the class executed on [Program.cs:11](https://github.com/winggar/Advent2022/blob/master/Program.cs#L11) to the solution you would like to run.
4. Build the project.
5. Paste your input into Advent2022/bin/(...)/input.txt
6. Run Advent2022.exe
